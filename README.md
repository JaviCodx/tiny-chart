# Test Tinybird

This is a test project for Tinybird

## Description

I first did check the implementation of the charts that you recently announced and check the docs, the implementation is pretty neat and good looking
so I have decided to expand on the same charts library but from another perspective, instead of a wrap with React I think it would be better to make web components since they can be used in all major [browsers](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1) and [frameworks](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/)


## Going forward

Some of the thing I would expand on:
- Bundle the widget lib with rollup and upload it to npm for public use
- Treeshake echarts, it is preatty heavy
- Types
- Improve testing, it is basic
- Test other frameworks
